The Rules for the H2H Fantasy Hockey League `The Cup`

## Draft Lottery
In order to have better lottery odds, a team must win out their matchups in the championship and consolation matchups in the playoffs.

The exceptions to this are the championship match (1st place gets worst odds), and the 9th and 10th place teams which do not enter the consolation bracket. 9th Position is decided by taking the aggregate scores of the H2H matchups between the 9th and 10th place teams, and determining who wins the most categories between them. In the event of a tie, the team that won the season series is declared 9th.
